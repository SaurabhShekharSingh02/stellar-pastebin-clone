Stellar Codes Pastebin
A Simple, Stylish Pastebin Clone
Welcome to Stellar Codes, a straightforward, single-page Pastebin clone designed for quickly sharing text snippets and code. This project was built for the "Cloud & DevOps: Building for Scale" hackathon challenge as a front-end proof of concept.

🚀 Live Demo
[Paste a link to your hosted site here, e.g., your GitHub Pages URL]

📋 Features
Instant URL Generation: Paste any text or code and instantly generate a shareable URL.

Client-Side Functionality: All logic for generating and displaying the paste is handled directly in the browser's JavaScript.

Aesthetic Design: A clean, modern interface with a dynamic bubble background animation for a unique user experience.

Expiry Date: A simple date picker to add an expiry date to the generated URL (client-side only).

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the core structure and content for the web page.

CSS: Custom styling for a visually appealing design, including gradients, card layout, and responsive elements.

JavaScript: Implements all interactive functionality, including:

Generating the URL with the paste content as a query parameter.

Displaying the paste content when a shared URL is opened.

Animating the background bubbles and handling sound effects.

💡 A Note on Persistence
This project is a static website and does not have a backend server or a database. The text content is stored directly in the URL as a query parameter, which is a key limitation. A truly scalable and robust Pastebin would require a dynamic backend to handle persistence, security, and longer text snippets.

🏃 Getting Started Locally
